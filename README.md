# CECS 327 Term Assignment 2 - Analytical Essay 

## Assignment Description
Your assignment is to write an analytical essay about a topic 
relating to this course: *Networks and Distributed Computing*. Your 
essay must have at least 3 unique academic-quality references and use 
the proper citation methods for **IEEE stylizing**, [which can be found here](https://ieee-dataport.org/sites/default/files/analysis/27/IEEE%20Citation%20Guidelines.pdf). The minimum  
length requirement is 3 stylized pages (about 750 words), with an upper-bound of 
around 6 pages or roughly 1500 words.

The depth of the analytical essay should reflect the complexity 
of an upper-division university term paper, which is to say that 
it should emphasize the analytical aspect of the writing much 
more than the summary aspect of writing (i.e. depth > breadth). 
Sample topics include (but are not limited to) the following:

* Clock Synchronization
* Internet Security and the Use of Firewalls
* Advancements in Distributed Computing Introduced with the Plan 9 Operating System
* Distributed Computing Usage in High-Traffic MMO Games
* Database Architecture and Distributed Computing
* Divide and Conquer Algorithms in Peer-to-Peer Architectures
* Real-Time Operating System Usage in Distributed Computing
* Load Balancing Performance on LAN Networks 
* Fault-Tolerance Methodologies

## Deliverables
Yes, we're using git to write research papers now! Maybe you find it annoying...but I find it awesome. :D

Submit your research paper through this git repository. Use one of the following formats:

* Plaintext (go old-school!)
* Markdown (it's like plain text--but better!)
* HTML (no one ever does this one...but it's neat, too, and you should think about it.)
* RTF (if you *must* use something like Word)
