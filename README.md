#CECS 327 Term Assignment 2 - Analytical Essay 

##Assignment Description

Your assignment is to write an analytical essay about a topic 
relating to this course: Networks and Distributed Computing. Your 
paper must be formated according to the IEEE style guide[footnote:
[https://www.ieee.org/documents/style_manual.pdf]
], have at least 3 unique academic-quality references, and use 
the proper citation methods for IEEE stylizing. The minimum page 
length requirement is 3 stylized pages, with an upper-bound of 
around 5-6 pages.

The depth of the analytical essay should reflect the complexity 
of an upper-division university term paper, which is to say that 
it should emphasize the analytical aspect of the writing much 
more than the summary aspect of writing (i.e. depth > breadth). 
Sample topics include (but are not limited to) the following:

• Clock Synchronization

• Internet Security and the Use of Firewalls

• Advancements in Distributed Computing Introduced with the Plan 
  9 Operating System

• Distributed Computing Usage in High-Traffic MMO Games

• Database Architecture and Distributed Computing

• Divide and Conquer Algorithms in Peer-to-Peer Architectures

• Real-Time Operating System Usage in Distributed Computing

• Load Balancing Performance on LAN Networks 

• Fault-Tolerance Methodologies

  Deliverables.
