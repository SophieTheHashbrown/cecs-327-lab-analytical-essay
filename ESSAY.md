Using a distributed system for medical purposes involves interconnecting multiple computers or other electronic devices and having them work together to manage and process medical data. For example, a hospital may choose to use a cloud server or data center to help them manage and store data for them. This has many benefits for both the patient and the doctor but it also can be dangerous when it comes to data privacy concerns. In this essay, we will examine the two sides of using distributed computing systems in the medical industry and why they can be incredibly helpful and why they could possibly make sensitive medical data vulnerable. 
In class, we talked about spreading our data out among many computers in a networked system. We also talked about how this can be dangerous for our data. Spreading data to multiple locations now means we need to protect all those locations and not just one central location. This is an added level of complexity and it can become hard to protect a wide distributed system from being partially or fully broken into and data being taken. 
With a distributed system in the medical world, this same concept applies. Medical data is no longer kept in one central location. It is spread out among the many computers that make up the distributed system which can be a serious drawback when it comes to data privacy [1]. For example, a patient's data can be spread among multiple cloud servers or a data center. Medical data is highly sensitive and is protected by regulations such as HIPAA which medical personnel must comply with [2]. By spreading out this data among different computers that make up our distributed system, we can make it easier for HIPAA violations to occur and medical data can fall into the wrong hands. 
Our data can be breached which means someone can get unauthorized access to patient data and data can end up exposed or misused [3]. For example, phishing attacks could trick users into revealing sensitive information through fake emails and websites. Malware attacks can lead to malicious software infecting our system [4]. We can use Encryption, as we have learned in school, to protect this data so only the people we want to see the data can see it. We can also use authentication methods such as multi factor authentication to ensure only the people who should be seeing something see it. We typically use this daily when we attend college classes to sign into our accounts to prevent data breaches. 
Moving onto the benefits, distributed systems in health care provide access to more resources and better resource allocation in terms of time and money.Doctors can collaborate since data can be exchanged and shared over a network. Doctors can also see patients from the comfort of their home or patients can see their doctor from the comfort of their home and vice versa. This saves one or both parties on time and money. Furthermore, this saved time allows doctors to see more patients and the saved money leaves resources that can be allocated in more places. Lastly, this also means doctors have a wider range of people they can help. Underdeveloped or underserved areas can now have access to these doctors for consultations, checkups, diagnoses, etc [5].
Other benefits include scalability and redundancy. With a distributed network system, we can scale up and down as needed easily. For example, covid accelerated the adoption of telemedicine [6]. When we need more computing power and data storage to run a medical facilitly, we can expland. When demand goes down, we are able to easily scale back and only use the resources that we need without wasting money and power. Furthermore, a distributed system provides redundancy. If one server fails, we have data on another one. This is crucial on a medical system because we can’t lose data or it’s literally life and death in some cases [7]. 
To conclude, implementing a distributed network system in a medical setting can be highly beneficial. It can provide the ability for doctors and patients to better allocate their resources due to time and cost savings. It can help with scalability as well and introduce redundancy to prevent the loss of critical medical data in crucial times. However, spreading out data can also weaken our security over this data. Measures must be taken to make sure this data is protected so that we can reap the benefits of integrating a distributed network system into our medical services while mitigating the drawbacks.
